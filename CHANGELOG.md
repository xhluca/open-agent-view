# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented here. This project has no published
release yet; entries under “Unreleased” describe the current private pre-alpha
and may change before the first tag.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and future released versions are intended to follow Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Provider-neutral Ratatui dashboard with Claude-style state grouping,
  navigation, details/peek, filtering, contextual help, composers,
  confirmations, directory grouping, responsive layouts, and JSON output.
- Host Claude discovery, background launch, native attach, reconstructed log
  inspection, and exact ownership-gated stop.
- Durable host Codex App Server discovery and managed launch, native resume,
  bounded transcript inspection, reply/steer, exact-turn interrupt, archive,
  and delete.
- Reconnectable Codex server-request handling for one-shot command decisions,
  safe denials, and sequential non-secret structured answers, with an exclusive
  controller lease and exact request/thread/turn checks.
- Explicit observe-only Docker discovery and a separately protected managed
  container create/start/status/list/stop/remove CLI.
- Private ownership registries, immutable target validation, diagnostics,
  deterministic mocks/fixtures, minimum-Rust CI, and prepared tag-gated release
  automation.
- Installation, CLI, recovery, security, contribution, exploration, and
  reproducible real-TTY/fresh-container validation documentation.

### Security

- Container lifecycle requires matching immutable ID, random instance label,
  and private external owner record; labels alone do not confer authority.
- Managed Codex control verifies persisted Linux process identity and never
  signals a PID loaded directly from disk.
- Expanded or incompletely rendered provider requests remain native-only; no
  request is answered automatically.
- Dynamic provider/runtime/session/summary/group/warning/notice/confirmation
  text is terminal-control sanitized, display-width bounded, and tested with
  wide graphemes.

### Known limitations

- No tag, release archive, checksum, public package, or supported stable version
  is published.
- No authenticated Claude/Codex lifecycle has been recorded inside the fresh
  credential-free Docker TUI probes.
- File-change acceptance, permission grants, MCP form/URL acceptance, secret
  input, Codex supervisor stop/status/log rotation, and managed-container
  session launch/control remain incomplete.
- SSH and broader terminal/theme/platform validation remain release gates.
